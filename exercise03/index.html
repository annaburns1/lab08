        <p class="title">All About James Naismith</p>
        <p class="para">James Naismith was born on November 6, 1861 in Ontario, Canada. He is best known
            as the "Father of Basketball" because, well, he is! He invented basketball in 1891 while teaching
            P.E. at the YMCA.  A few years later, he arrived at The University of Kansas (the best university in the
            world, some might say), where he was the athletic director and basketball coach. Naismith passed away
            on November 28, 1939, but his legacy lives on forever!
